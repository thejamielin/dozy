## Inspiration
After enduring three years of college, team Dozy is no stranger to sleep deprivation and egregious sleeping habits. We understand how hard it is to get your sleep schedule (and life) back on track all by yourself, so we decided to create an app that encouraged better sleeping habits. 

### Problem Statements
College students have inconsistent sleep schedules that are conducive to sleep deprivation.
Blue light from phones and the addictive nature of using apps prevent people from sleeping earlier and getting enough sleep.

## What it does
Dozy is a mobile app that allows you to track your own sleeping habits through taking care of your sleepy accountability partner/pet. 
- Customize your daily sleeping goal.
- Every time you go to bed, you prompt Dozy to also go to sleep. When you wake up for the day, you can toggle Dozy awake, and the app automatically calculates how much sleep you’ve gotten for the night. 
- Keep track of how consistent you’ve been staying with your sleep goal.
- Dozy stays healthy as long as you keep hitting your sleep goals. If you get less sleep, Dozy gets less sleep and gets sick. You can nurse Dozy back to health by getting more sleep.
- Contains an information page on how to practice better sleeping habits.

## How we built it
Because we wanted Dozy to be accessible and convenient, we decided Dozy should be a mobile app. We utilized Expo Go to create our app and was able to simulate the app as we developed on our computers. We utilized the React Native and React Native Paper libraries with TypeScript for our front-end. For the back-end, we used our very own sponsor Convex’s platform. 

## Challenges we ran into
Our 24-hour journey was filled with many challenges, including…
- Learning Convex
  - It was pretty difficult to test our functionality without manually testing it through the Convex dashboard. Because testing took up a lot of our time, we couldn’t spend as much time developing.
- Developing for Mobile
  - Some of our computers could not utilize Expo to simulate the iOS version of our app, so the development process was a lot slower since we could not see how our design implementations translated onto the phone.
- Getting JSON animations to appear
  - Trying to use the animation library Lottie had a lot of issues
- Sleeping on the floor and trying to sleep
  - Oh, the irony of developing a sleeping helper app! Sleeping during a hackathon at 12am is like trying to convince a toddler that broccoli tastes better than a lollipop. Some of us couldn’t sleep because of how loud the other hackers were in the atrium, and some of us ended up sleeping on the hardwood floor. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Getting the functionality our app working
- The Design Process and Ideating
  - We had a solid brainstorming session and even though none of us had UI/UX experience, we still created a couple of wireframes to outline the flow of our app!
- Learning a new back-end platform	
  - Although we had the option of using other back-end frameworks, we decided to use our resources, and we had a lot of fun in the process! Shout out to the Convex team during office hours
- Learning Typescript
  - For some of us, it was our first time ever using TypeScript! We still pulled off this project, let’s goooo
- Making the most of our night 
  - Not only have we been able to work on less than 4 hours of sleep, we had a blast getting to meet each other, indulging on Boloco burritos, enjoying the nice weather during dinner, seeing a groundhog, running away from the largest spiders we have ever seen, and building something as a team! 

## What we learned
- Convex
- Mobile App development
  - Getting familiar with ReactNative and Expo Go
- How to survive a hackathon
  - Bring toiletries, a pillow, sleep buds/ear plugs, bring a change of clothes, make use of office hours, and surround yourself with people who love to have fun and are open to learning new things

## What's next for Dozy and Future Features
Dozy will take the world by storm and help people get their lives back on track. Here are some future features we could implement.
- Ability to ping User to come back to Dozy if they leave the app to do other apps on their phone
- Ability to see the pets of your friends
- Add more pets to choose from the more you successfully maintain good sleeping habits
- Integrate our app with a health device, like Fitbit or AppleWatch so that taking care of Dozy can be done automatically
